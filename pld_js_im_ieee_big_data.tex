We implement the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm in Apache Hadoop MapReduce and describe how we use the ADMM algorithm to compute logistic regression as a subcomponent in a larger modeling pipeline.  We present a distributed logistic regression algorithm and implementation that performs well without parameter tuning.  We describe practical lessons learned in implementing an open source ADMM MapReduce algorithm.  Furthermore, we describe the advantages to staying implementing an iterative algorithm for Hadoop and remaining within the Hadoop ecosystem.

\section{Introduction}
When modeling at scale the solution not only needs to function correctly, it needs to function on large amounts of data in a reasonable amount of time.  In this context, modeling is often approached in a two step process, the first step is to prototype a solution on a sample of the dataset, and the second step is to run it on a production scale dataset.  In many cases production datasets do not fit into the memory available on a single machine and we need to distribute the dataset over a set of machines.

The MapReduce programming model \cite{dean2004} allows us to work with large distributed datasets using commodity machines.  We use the Apache Hadoop \cite{white2009} implementation of MapReduce which is well known, widely used, and supported by many cloud computing providers.  We provide details of implementing an efficient iterative algorithm in Hadoop and how to overcome the challenges of network latency when transferring large amounts of data between clusters within the Amazon ecosystem. 

When using distributed datasets we must use algorithms that can compute on distributed datasets.  Our algorithms must be able to compute a partial solution on a subset of the data and then later combine these partial solutions to produce a complete solution.  The ADMM algorithm is a distributed convex optimization algorithm that allows us to fit logistic regression, lasso, $\ell1$ and $\ell2$ norm, support vector machine, and other popular models.  We can use it without having to hand-tune parameters, which is especially time-consuming when executing long-running modeling jobs.

The model that we prototyped predicted the estimated value $\hat{y}$ as the expectation of the target value $b$ given that this target value is greater than zero and there is a matrix of features $\mathbf{A}$, multiplied by the probability that the target is greater than zero given the features.  We express this as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \mathbb{E}[b|b>0,\mathbf{A}]\Pr(b>0|\mathbf{A}),
\label{eq:formula}
\end{equation}
where we fit the expectation, $\mathbb{E}[b|b>0,\mathbf{A}]$, using linear regression and we fit the conditional probability, $\Pr(b>0|\mathbf{A})$, using logistic regression.  This model performed quite well in prototyping, and the next step was to test it on a production scale dataset.  Fitting a linear regression model is possible using an analytic method, therefore we use matrix algebra to compute the analytic solution and predict the expectation in Equation \ref{eq:formula}.

However, there is no analytic solution for logistic regression.  To fit the logistic regression model we must use an approximate method.  Many of the approximate methods traditionally used to fit logistic regression require access to the entirety of the training dataset at once, i.e. they require that the training dataset can be fit into memory.  These methods require that memory scale with the size of the dataset, and they cannot be distributed.

The ADMM algorithm does not have this property.  The ADMM algorithm is an optimization algorithm suitable for convex optimization which can be used to compute logistic regression on subdivided portions of the training data and then combine the calculations on each portion to find a global solution \cite{boyd}.  Because of this the ADMM algorithm is amenable to the MapReduce programming model which distributes computations to multiple nodes.  On each iteration the ADMM algorithm optimizes the objective function for each portion of training data and then aggregates these predictions to find the global solution.  This is the algorithm we will use to fit a logistic regression model and predict the probability in Equation \ref{eq:formula}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In section \ref{sec:imp} we provide details concerning our implementation of the ADMM algorithm, its application to logistic regression, and how to implement it in Hadoop MapReduce.  In section \ref{sec:results} we present the results of running ADMM on a production scale datasets, which includes the improvement in the objective function.  In section \ref{sec:related} we review recent work related to iterative optimization with Hadoop, and in section \ref{sec:conc} we conclude.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:imp}
Here we describe exactly how we implemented ADMM for Hadoop MapReduce and provide practical details relevant to using it to build models in a production environment.

\subsection{Logistic Regression with ADMM}
Given a matrix of features $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbf{R}^{n\times m}$ and a vector of their labels $b\in\mathbf{R}^n$ with $b_i\in\{-1,1\}$, our goal is to compute the probability $\text{Pr}(B_i=b_i|\mathbf{A}_i)$ for each row $0<i\leq n$.

To compute this probability we use ADMM to fit a logistic regression model using ADMM.  We begin by expressing the logistic regression problem in ADMM form as:
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize}&\quad (1/2)\|\mathbf{A}x-b\|_2^2+\lambda\|z\|_1\\
\text{subject to}&\quad Fx-z=0,
\end{align*}
where we have introduced the regularization factor $\lambda$, the $x$ and $z$ variables, and the matrix of second differences $F$.

Given this form we construct the ADMM algorithm:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:x}
x_i^{k+1} :=&\quad \min_{x_i} \sum_{j=1}^Nl(\mathbf{A}_{ij}x_i\times b_{ij}) + \dfrac{\rho^k}{2}\|x_i - z^k + u_i^k\|_2^2\\
\label{eq:z}
z^{k+1} :=&\quad \begin{cases}
    x_0^{k+1} + u_0^k& \text{if $i=0$}\\
    \\
    \dfrac{m}{2\lambda}(x_i^{k+1} + u_i^k)& \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}\\
\nonumber\\
\label{eq:u}
u_i^{k+1} :=&\quad u_i^k + x_i^{k+1} + z^{k+1},
\end{align}
where $l$ is the logistic loss function with $\ell1$ regularization,
\begin{equation*}
l(\alpha)=\log(1+\exp(-\alpha)),
\end{equation*}
$m$ is the number of mappers (explained below), and $\rho^k$ is the penalty parameter for iteration $k$, which is used as the step size. \todo{$\mathbf{A_i}$ and $b_i$ are the portion of the data used in mapper $m_i$.}

To solve the minimization function in the $x_i$ update we use the quasi-Newton method of Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno---the BFGS method \cite{bonnans2003numerical}.  BFGS is a hill-climbing algorithm that approximates Newton's method and has proven good performance even for non-smooth functions.  We use a Java implementation of BFGS which is self contained and has performed well on Hadoop nodes.\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/vladium/}}

\subsection{ADMM within MapReduce}
The MapReduce model divides into three phases: the map, the shuffle, and the reduce.  In the mapper phase the input data is split among a set of mappers and each mapper applies a function to the set of data assigned to it.  In the shuffle phase the output of the mappers is assigned to a reducer, and then in the reduce phase the mapper output is aggregated to create the final values.

We may express the map and reduce steps the as:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
&\text{map}\quad &(k_1,v_2)\quad\rightarrow &\texttt{list}(k_2,v_2)\\
&\text{reduce}\quad &(k_2,\texttt{list}(v_2))\quad\rightarrow &\texttt{list}(v_2),
\end{alignat*}
where each mapper has a unique key $k_1$.  The shuffle is concerned with mapping the intermediate key-value pairs, $(k_2,v_2)$, output by the mappers to the reducers \cite{dean2004}.

To implement MapReduce in Hadoop we must define classes for the mapper, the reducer, and a driver that handles input arguments and specifies the mapper and reducer classes (the shuffle is handled by Hadoop).  In the context of ADMM each mapper performs the resource intensive task of computing the current $x_i$.  After all mappers have completed their computations, we use a single reducer to compute the $z$ and $u_i$ updates.

\subsubsection{Peristent Data with Input Splits}
In the ADMM algorithm, when each mapper calculates the $x_i^{k+1}$ values, on iteration $k+1$, it must use the $u_i^k$ values that were calculated for the same mapper in the previous iteration, $k$.  Hadoop does not normally accommodate this sort of persistence.  \cite{boyd} suggest using Apache HBase, a distributed data store, however this would add a new component and its accompanying complexity to the modeling framework.

As an alternative, we use Hadoop's notion of input splits to keep track of where data is stored and to associate the correct $x_i$ and $u_i$ values with each other.  Input splits specify a \emph{split length} and a \emph{split ID}, which determine the size of the split data and the node on which to execute the split, respectively.  To ensure that the correct $u_i$ values are loaded when calculating an $x_i$ value, the mapper reads the split ID and chooses the $u_i$ values based on this split ID.  The $z$ values are the same in each $x_i$ formula, i.e. across mappers, and we simply replicate the current $z$ values across all mappers at the start of each iteration.

\subsubsection{Automatically Updating $\rho$}

We use the reducer to update the penalty parameter $\rho$.  The number of iterations before convergence depends upon the $\rho$ parameter, and hand-tuning $\rho$ can take a significant amount of time.  This is because we must wait for the algorithm to complete before determining the efficacy of the chosen $\rho$.

By varying the penalty parameter we can reduce the performance impact of our initial choice of $\rho$, and avoid spending time hand-tuning $\rho$.  We use the update scheme suggested in \cite{boyd} to update $\rho$ on each iteration:
\begin{equation}
\rho^{k+1}:=\begin{cases}
  \tau^{\text{incr}}\rho^k&\quad \text{if $\|r^k\|_2>\mu\|s^k\|_2$}\\
  \rho^k/\tau^{\text{decr}}&\quad \text{if $\|s^k\|_2>\mu\|r^k\|_2$}\\
  \rho^k&\quad \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:r}
\end{equation}
where $\mu>1$, $\tau^{\text{incr}}>1$, and $\tau^{\text{decr}}>1$ are parameters.  We have used the typical values of $\mu=10$ and $\tau^{\text{incr}}=\tau^{\text{decr}}=2$.

\subsubsection{Considerations for MapReduce}
After having completed a mapper and reducer cycle,  the algorithm will have completed one iteration and control returns to the driver.  In addition to initiating the mapper and reducer tasks, the ADMM driver determines if the algorithm has converged.  If it has not converged we distribute the $z$ and $u_i$ to the mappers and begin the next iteration.  If it has converged we write the results to persistent storage, a bucket on Amazon's simple storage service (Amazon S3), and exit.  This is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:admm} below.

\begin{algorithm}
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{feature matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and vector of target values $b$}
\KwResult{a vector of predicted weights $z$}
$k=0$\\
$m=\text{[the number of mapper nodes]}$\\
\While{$k<\text{maxIterations}$ and $\text{curSt} > \text{preSt}$}{
  \For{$i=1\to m$}{
    update $x_i^k$ using Eq. \ref{eq:x}\\
    $i \gets i + 1$
  }
  update $z^k$ using Eq. \ref{eq:z}\\
  \For{$i=1\to m$}{
     update $u_i^k$ using Eq. \ref{eq:u}\\
    $i \gets i + 1$
  }
  update $\rho^k$ using Eq. \ref{eq:r}\\
  $k \gets k + 1$
}
write $z^k$ to S3.
\label{alg:admm}
\vspace{1em}
\caption{ADMM algorithm implemented for Hadoop MapReduce.}
\end{algorithm}

The input data that is used in the algorithm is stored in Amazon S3.  To reduce the network latency involved in transferring data from Amazon S3 to the MapReduce nodes, we store the data---feature matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and target values $b$---in the nodes' local HDFS file systems.  We use Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) service to execute Hadoop, this allows us to avoid any data transfer fees.  This is the workflow shown in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}

Wherever feasible we have made the implementation of the ADMM algorithm generic.  Arguments to the driver allow users to exclude columns from the input data, add an intercept, set the initial $\rho$, maximum number of iterations, and the input and output locations. We have released an implementation of the ADMM algorithm for Hadoop as an open source Java package.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/intentmedia/admm}}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
We run the ADMM algorithm daily on nearly a terabyte of data.  To evaluate the performance we will examine the iterative output of one day's run.  Figure \ref{fig:iter} shows the difference between the predicted function and the actual function per iteration in the left panel, and the time per iteration in the right panel.  We see that the accuracy consistently improves and the run-time consistently decreases for later iterations.

\caption{Loss between our models predictions and the actual values per iteration on a logarithmic scale.  We see that the loss decreases dramatically and then decelerates at later iterations.}
\label{fig:iter}
\end{figure}

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
The algorithm and our implementation are based upon \cite{boyd}, which introduced the ADMM algorithm.  \cite{bu2010} presents a more efficient approach to iterative computation in Hadoop with modifications to the core Hadoop that reduce the costs of transferring data.  This is not the approach we took, we decided to stay within the Hadoop ecosystem and avoid the costs associated with a less well known solution.  Based on our experience MapReduce is "good enough", in the sense of the reduction in implementation costs outweigh potential performance improvements \cite{lin2012}, for ADMM and logistic regression. \cite{planet} presents a MapReduce implementation of tree ensemble learning and involves writer a wrapper to MapReduce that coordinates iterations of the underlying algorithm.

Mahout and why we didn't use it.  

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
We have presented our implementation of the ADMM algorithm for Hadoop MapReduce.  Having an ADMM implementation allows us to more easily move our modeling ideas from prototype to production scale.  We showed a specific example of using the ADMM algorithm to build a logistic regression model, however ADMM is a general optimization algorithm that we can apply to other modeling problems.  Having a generic distributed optimization algorithm reduces the risk of experimenting with different models at scale.
