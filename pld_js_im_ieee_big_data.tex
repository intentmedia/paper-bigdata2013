% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{images/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{url}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\Min}{Min}
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We present a distributed logistic regression algorithm and implementation that performs effectively without parameter tuning.
Although many well known solutions exist, implementing iterative algorithms at scale is a non-trivial exercise.  We implement the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm in Apache Hadoop MapReduce and describe how we use the ADMM algorithm to compute logistic regression as a subcomponent in a larger modeling pipeline.  We describe practical lessons learned in implementing an open source ADMM MapReduce algorithm.

\section{Introduction}
When modeling at scale the solution not only needs to function correctly, it needs to function on large amounts of data in a reasonable amount of time.  In this context, modeling is often approached in a two step process, the first step is to prototype a solution on a sample of the dataset, and the second step is to run it on a production scale dataset.  In many cases production datasets do not fit into the memory available on a single machine and we will need to distribute the dataset over a set of machines.

The MapReduce programming model \cite{dean2004} allows us to work with large distributed data sets.  We use the Apache Hadoop \cite{white2009} implementation of MapReduce which is widely used and supported by many cloud computing providers.  We provide details of implementing an efficient iterative algorithm in Hadoop and how to overcome the challenges of network latency when transferring large amounts of data between clusters in the Amazon ecosystem. 

When using distributed datasets we must use algorithms which can compute on distributed datasets.  The ADMM algorithm is a distributed convex optimization algorithm that allows us to fit logistic regression, lasso, $\l1$ and $\l2$ norm, support vector machine, and other popular models.  We can use without having to hand-tune parameters, which is especially time-consuming with long-running modeling jobs.

The model that we prototyped predicted the estimated value $\hat{y}$ as the expectation of the target value $b$ given that this target value is greater than zero and there is a matrix of features $A$, multiplied by the probability that the target is greater than zero given the features.  We express this as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \mathbb{E}[b|b>0,\mathbf{A}]P(b>0|\mathbf{A}),
\end{equation}
where we fit the expectation, $\mathbb{E}[b|b>0,\mathbf{A}]$, using linear regression and we fit the conditional probability, $P(b>0|\mathbf{A})$, using logistic regression.  This model performed quite well in prototyping, and the next step was to test it on a production scale dataset.  Fitting linear regression is simple and we use matrix algebra to compute an analytic solution.  However, there is no analytic solution for logistic regression.

To fit the logistic regression model we must use an approximate method.  Many of the approximate methods traditionally used to fit logistic regression require access to the entire training dataset at once, i.e. they require that the training data set can be fit into memory and because of this they cannot be distributed.  However, the ADMM algorithm does not have this property.

The ADMM algorithm is an optimization algorithm suitable for convex optimization which can be used to compute logistic regression on subdivided portions of the training data and then combine the calculations on each portion to find a global solution \cite{boyd}.  Because of this the ADMM algorithm is amenable to the MapReduce programming model which distributes computations to multiple nodes.  On each iteration the ADMM algorithm optimizes the objective function for each portion of training data, it then aggregates these predictions to find the global solution.

In section \ref{sec:imp} we provide details concerning our implementation of the ADMM algorithm, its application to logistic regression, and how to implement it in Hadoop MapReduce.  In section \ref{sec:results} we present the results of running ADMM on a production scale datasets including the improvement in the objective function and the computation time taken per iteration.  In section \ref{sec:related} we review recent work related to iterative optimization with Hadoop, and in section \ref{sec:conc} we conclude and mention future work.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:imp}
Here we describe exactly how we implemented ADMM for Hadoop MapReduce and provide practical details relevant to using it to build models in a production environment.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\subsection{Logistic Regression with ADMM}
Given a matrix of features $A\in\mathbf{R}^{n\times m}$ and a vector of their labels $b\in\{-1,1\}$, our goal is to compute the probability $\text{Pr}(B_i=b_i|\mathbf{A}_i)$ for each row $0<i\leq n$.

To compute this probability we fit a logistic regression model using ADMM.  We begin by expressing the logistic regression problem in ADMM form as:
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize}&\quad (1/2)\|Ax-b\|_2^2+\lambda\|z\|_1\\
\text{subject to}&\quad Fx-z=0,
\end{align*}
where we have introduced the regularization factor $\lambda$, as well as the $x$ and $z$ variables.

Given this form we construct the ADMM algorithm:
\begin{align*}
x_i^{k+1} :=&\quad \min_x \sum_{j=1}^Nf(A_jx\times b_j) + \dfrac{\rho^k}{2}\|x - z_i + u_i\|_2^2\\
\\
z_i^{k+1} :=&\quad \begin{cases}
    x_0^{k+1} + u_0^k& \text{if $i=0$}\\
    \\
    \dfrac{m}{2\lambda}(x_i^{k+1} + u_i^k)& \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}\\
\\
u_i^{k+1} :=&\quad u_i^k + x_i^{k+1} + z_i^{k+1},
\end{align*}
where $f$ is the negative log of the logistic function:
\begin{align*}
f(\alpha)=&-\log(\text{logit}^{-1}(\alpha))\\
=&-\log\left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\alpha)}\right)\\
=&\log(1+\exp(-\alpha)),
\end{align*}
$m$ is the number of mappers (explained below), and $\rho^k$ is the penalty parameter for iteration $k$, which is used as the step size.

To solve the minimization function in the $x_i$ update we use the quasi-Newton method of Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno---the BFGS method \cite{bonnans2003numerical}.  BFGS is a hill-climbing algorithm that approximates Newton's method and has proven good performance even for non-smooth functions.  We use a Java implementation of BFGS which is self contained and has performed well on Hadoop nodes.\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/vladium/}}

\subsection{ADMM within MapReduce}
MapReduce tasks consist of three components: mappers which apply a function to a set of values, reducers which aggregate multiple values, and a driver which handles input arguments and coordinates execution of the mappers and reducers.  To apply ADMM in the context of MapReduce we use multiple mappers, each of which performs the resource intensive task of computing the current $x_i^{k+1}$.  After all mappers have completed their computations, we use a single reducer to compute the $z_i^{k+1}$ and $u_i^{k+1}$ updates.

We also use the reducer to update the penalty parameter $\rho$.  The number of iterations before convergence depends upon the $\rho$ parameter, and hand-tuning the $\rho$ parameter can take a significant amount of time.  We must wait for the algorithm to complete before determining the efficacy of the chosen $\rho$.  By varying the penalty parameter we can reduce the performance impact of our initial choice of $\rho$, and avoid spending time hand-tuning $\rho$.  We use the update scheme suggested in \cite{boyd} to update $\rho$ on each iteration:
\begin{equation}
\rho^{k+1}:=\begin{cases}
  \tau^{\text{incr}}\rho^k&\quad \text{if $\|r^k\|_2>\mu\|s^k\|_2$}\\
  \rho^k/\tau^{\text{decr}}&\quad \text{if $\|s^k\|_2>\mu\|r^k\|_2$}\\
  \rho^k&\quad \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\mu>1$, $\tau^{\text{incr}}>1$, and $\tau^{\text{decr}}>1$ are parameters, and we have used the typical values of $\mu=10$ and $\tau^{\text{incr}}=\tau^{\text{decr}}=2$.

After having completed a mapper and reducer cycle, one iteration of the algorithm has finished and control returns to the driver.  In addition to initiating the mapper and reducer tasks, the ADMM driver determines if the algorithm has converged.  If it has not converged we distribute the $z_i$ and $u_i$ to the mappers and begin the next iteration, if it has converged we write the results to persistent storage (a bucket on Amazon S3) and exit.

Wherever feasible we have made the implementation of the ADMM algorithm generic.  Arguments to the driver allow users to exclude columns from the input data, add an intercept, set the initial $\rho$, maximum number of iterations, and of course the input and output locations. We have released an implementation of the ADMM algorithm for Hadoop as an open source Java package.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/intentmedia/admm}}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
To evaluate the performance of the ADMM algorithm we ran it on a generated test dataset.  Figure \ref{fig:itertime} pacman -Qqo /bin /sbin /usr/sbin | pacman -Qm -shows the difference between the predicted function and the actual function per iteration in the left panel, and the time per iteration in the right panel.  We see that the accuracy consistently improves and the run-time consistently decreases for later iterations.

We additional test our ADMM implementation on a dataset that has been divided into subgroups in the worst possible way, the first group contains only positive examples and the second only negative examples.  Figure \ref{fig:itertime-wc} shows the same accuracy and time per iteration.  We see that this takes longer to converge, yet it shows the same pattern of increased accuracy and decreased time for each subsequent iteration.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")

% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
The algorithm and our implementation are based upon \cite{boyd}, which introduced the ADMM algorithm.  \cite{bu2010} presents a more efficient approach to iterative computation in Hadoop with modifications to the core Hadoop that reduce the costs of transferring data.

Mahout and why we didn't use it.  

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
We have presented our implementation of the ADMM algorithm for Hadoop MapReduce.  Having an ADMM implementation allows us to more easily move our modeling ideas from prototype to production scale.  We showed a specific example of using the ADMM algorithm to build a logistic regression model, however ADMM is a general optimization algorithm that we can apply to other modeling problems.  Having a generic distributed optimization algorithm reduces the risk of experimenting with different models at scale.

\cite{planet} presents a similar implementation discussion concerning the challenges of using MapReduce for tree learning.
